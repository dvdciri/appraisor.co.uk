## Built to bring everything together

I built Appraisor to make property analysis faster, simpler, and accessible to everyone.

Too many investors still rely on clunky spreadsheets, endless tabs, and scattered data just to answer one question: is this property worth it?

As a software engineer, I knew we could automate valuations, comparables, and refurb estimates — all in one place.

Property insights should be affordable and accurate — not locked behind expensive tools or big teams.
